# TCP/IP Encapsulation Project

This project implements a TCP-based client-server application using Python sockets
and demonstrates how application-layer messages are encapsulated into TCP/IP packets.

Application messages are defined in a CSV file and transmitted over a TCP connection
on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). The encapsulation process is analyzed using
Wireshark, allowing inspection of TCP headers, control flags, and payload data.

## Project Contents
- Python implementation of a TCP client and server
- CSV file representing application-layer messages
- Jupyter Notebook demonstrating TCP/IP encapsulation
- Wireshark packet capture (.pcapng) for traffic analysis
- Execution instructions for running the application

## How to Run
Detailed execution steps are provided in the RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.txt file.
